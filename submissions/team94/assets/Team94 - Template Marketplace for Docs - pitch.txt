We'd like to propose the addition of a template marketplace for the Docs application.
The goal is to allow users to create a document from an existing template.

For end users, this will simplify document creation, resulting in time saving and increased productivity. It will also allow them to focus on content rather than formatting. Finally, there is a brand or community-driven benefit: templates help reflect the identity and culture of a community/brand through the structure and appearance of its documents.

As for the functionality, here is what weâ€™ve (more or less) achieved:
 * Document duplication
 * Creating a document from a template
 * Creating a template from an existing document
 
As an additional achievement, slightly aside the main feature, we encountered some many installation issues with the project on our professional Windows laptops, that two of us worked on creating a Windows installation script (Powershell script similar to the Make one already existing), that is available in our project.

This template marketplace feature, via its collaborative and sharing dimension, is an opportunity for the Docs community to grow.
Our vision for the future is to 
 * provide a fully functional management of the templates, with edition, deletion, sharing, popularity.
 * enhance the list of available templates
 * enhance the list of widgets available to write a document
