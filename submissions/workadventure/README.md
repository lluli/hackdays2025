- Make Docs working in an iframe
- Automatically create a document when creating the zone
- Ensuring responsiveness and a smooth UX across different screen sizes and devices.
- Making it intuitive for non-technical users to interact with the system.

## Impact

- Enhances the attractiveness of both WorkAdventure and La Suite by demonstrating real, valuable synergy.
## Next Steps

- Integrate voice/video zones with contextual document previews (e.g. "open meeting doc" when entering a bubble).
- Better authentication handling
- Integrate other LaSuite tools
- Choose the file to share in the area (can be a personal one)
