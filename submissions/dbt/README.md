## Project
FactVerifAI

## Project Description
FactVerifAI adds seamless, AI-powered fact-checking capabilities to Docs, an open-source collaborative document editor. Users can highlight text and receive a real-time accuracy score backed by sources and transparent reasoning. The goal: empower users to write and collaborate with greater trust in the facts they share.

## Deliverables 
(Provide a link to a live demo, if you have one)
(Add screenshots (image, gif or video) and presentation deck to `/assets`)

## Key Achievements
Successfully prototyped and integrated an AI fact-checking tool directly into the Docs interface
Built and deployed a modular API using Python and Ollama 3.1 for LLM-driven text analysis
Real-time factual scoring system with source transparency (links + explanation)
Collaborated with DINUM and La Suite to align with European digital sovereignty goals

## Challenges Overcome
Balancing speed and accuracy in the fact-checking model
Ensuring reliable source extraction and scoring within limited time constraints
Integrating seamlessly into the Docs platform while respecting data protection and transparency principles
Managing multiple language/model dependencies and preparing for multilingual use cases
## Impact
FactVerifAI supports anyone working in collaborative document environments: journalists, policymakers, educators, researchers by enhancing trust and accountability. It contributes to European digital sovereignty by offering a sovereign, open-source, privacy-respecting alternative to fact-checking solutions embedded in non-European platforms.

## Next Steps
Improve the AI model‚Äôs ability to handle nuance and context (e.g., satire, ambiguous claims)
Develop a more intuitive and informative UI for source display
Expand support for multiple European languages
Optimize performance and scalability for wider public deployment
Conduct user testing with public sector teams across the EU to refine UX and functionality
