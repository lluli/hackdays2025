## Project
📨 **MailGuard**

## Project Description
🔐 **MailGuard** is a lightweight, **AI-enhanced** plugin for the **Open-Xchange** email client that **protects users from phishing threats** by scoring incoming emails in real time.
It analyzes tone, urgency, sender identity, and embedded links, using both machine learning and threat intelligence to alert users via a color-coded risk bar. 
Clear, contextual warnings and actionable tips help users make smarter decisions with every email.
