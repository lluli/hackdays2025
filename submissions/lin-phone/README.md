* [demo video](assets/Tchap%20phone%20call%20during%20hackaton.MOV)

## Key Achievements
* Provides Tchap users with phone connectivity using open source software.

## Challenges Overcome
* Adapt webRTC media streams to SIP trunk provider regular RTP.
* Use Element Widget for In-room access to dialer
* Hack Element to add a Global Call button. 

## Impact
* Add phone call capability to ¬´¬†La suite¬†¬ª.
* Main impact is about user experience. Even if technically doable to have different applications for regular phone calls and for chat (I.E Element/Tchap), with a deep user interface integration, it would be quite obvious for Tchap users to place phone calls without having to switch to an other app.


## Next Steps
* Single sign on using OIDC
* Incoming calls based on Matrix service API
